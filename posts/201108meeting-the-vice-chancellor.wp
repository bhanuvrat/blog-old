<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">Yesterday I personally met the Vice Chancellor of Amity University for the first time. Everything happened so fast that it took me a while to realise what had happened. I got this opportunity without doing something exceptionally good or falling into deep trouble.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Flashback</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It was the first weekend of this semester and I with a few members of ALiAS, (The Linux Club @ Amity) were sitting and hacking. The objective was to create an android application which would transmit data to an external device over using Bluetooth as the medium. The hardware was developed by Mr Chaddha and it was his idea to be able to control the device remotely. We sat and were ready with a working prototype in less than 20 hours. The excitement of the programmers when a button press on the phone caused a light bulb on the device to glow, was out of all bounds. Initially the device had power sockets and was capable of switching on or switching off any thing plugged into it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Later the same technology was housed in an Executive Callbell created by Chaddha Jee. His idea was to eradicate the requirement of a man to walk in when ever the bell was rung by the executive, and then pass on the information to the person the Executive actually wanted to see. For this, Mr Chaddha had already created the hardware and a wired version was operational in VC's office. The VC wanted to be able use the bell irrespective of whether he was at his desk or not. And this is where our application came in. Only this time the buttons displayed names of his subordinates and pressing them would cause a corresponding LED to glow on the display panel outside.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So yesterday I visited VC's office, gave him the Android phone with the application and demonstrated its use. He was excited for the new application and so were we. To be true we still are :). The application is working properly but there is scope for a lot of tiny improvements which is what will keep us at ALiAS busy for quite sometime.</p></body></html>
