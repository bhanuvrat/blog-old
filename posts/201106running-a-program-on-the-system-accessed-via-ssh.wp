<html><body><div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Controlling anything remotely is always kinda exciting and fun. And when it comes to computers its even more exhilarating. So when I became aware of ssh I was excited. Tried poking fun at people in computer lab by logging into their system and closing their programs and rebooted their computer. For a command line freak like me its even more fun to be able to actually control another computer from terminal.<br>But if you have tried running a program which requires a GUI you would have found that it gives an error stating<br><div style='font-family:"'><pre class="console">Error: No Display found.<br></pre></div><br>I always wondered how that could be achieved but never knew really tried to find out. Today, however I decided to find out and blimey!!Â  a simple internet search revealed the answer. Prefix the program with this DISPLAY=:0. So if you want to run the terminal program on a gnome system run<br><div style='font-family:"'><pre class="console">$ DISPLAY=:0 gnome-terminal<br></pre></div><br>And BINGO !!!</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div></body></html>
