<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">I appeared in the placement drive for four companies and was rejected by each of them on different grounds. Having spent three weeks with a burden of tension now I feel compelled to think - should I waste any more time for something that I do not need and I do not want. These big brands that are turning up for recruiting on campus are service based industries and they clearly state that I wont have a say over what I would do after getting employed in their company. In other words I will have to work on the project and technology where they need workforce irrespective of my set of skills. And they will train me for working with those technologies. Keeping aside my wish to be working on and with Open Source stuff only, this sounds like they need computer literates with a tag of B.Tech, not engineers. Besides one of the recruiters had himself suggested me not to join any service based company at this stage, not even his. "It's not a place for a person of your calibre", his words.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everybody around me condemns my decision of not appearing for any company now.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>You must take up a job from the campus. If you are so talented, that you think you can go for even bigger brands, show that you can get a job here. Don't join but get placed.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The longer you take to get placed, the harder the pressure will get. When you see that all your friends and classmates are placed, all kinds of negative feelings will start creeping in. So try your level best and get placed in the next company that comes your way.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>So you are not sitting because you already have offers. Tell me what will happen if all of them back-off? What will you do then?</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Â This is the only thing college is giving, why not take it?</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Its not a waste of time, you gain experience by facing interviews. How will you move on in your life if you can't face rejection.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe, I am committing the biggest mistake of my life by not appearing for any of the service based companies. Maybe I will repent later, but I have thought of going on with my decision. Though I am considered to be the most technical and knowledgeable guy in campus, I know I still have a lot to learn for being where I want to be and there is no time. And I think that I will be able to use the remaining of my college days for doing exactly that.</p></body></html>
