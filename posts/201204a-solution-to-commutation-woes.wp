<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">Ask an average resident of a modern city - "what is it that you dislike most about your city" and the answer will most certainly include "traffic and commutation woes". The population density of the cities is growing at an alarming rate, more and more people are flooding in, in search of (seemingly) better - jobs, education, spouse (mostly husband) etc and seldom anyone retraces the path. The more the people more are vehicles - be it private or "bhade wali" (public). And the broadest of roads are, at times, not able to provide free passage to these vehicles and a commuter is subjected to the most frustrating of experiences - waiting indefinitely in a snailing, snoring, shrieking and farting traffic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If observed from a broader perspective, the current situation, apart from being uncomfortable, is extremely expensive, both economically and environmentally. So here is an idea that sprouted in my mind and has been pondered upon for quite some time (an year or two), mostly while being stuck in one of those (seemingly) never ending road jams.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Bicycles, one of the most efficient machines ever created, have been around for nearly one and a half centuries but in past few years their usage has been reduced to means of commutation for the "fourth grade staffs" or as a mere source of entertainment by chlidren. The ever-expanding cities make it impossible to commute from one end to other on one of those. So I propose, a <strong>City Wide Bicycle Network</strong> as the solution to all commutation woes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Taking the NCR (National Capital Region) for instance. The long distance commutation is taken care of by the excellent network of buses, local trains and most importantly Metro. The real problem is faced in traveling to and from the bus stand / metro station to the destination. The idea is to setup a cycle stand at every popular destination with heavy footfall and also at the bus stands and metro stations, which shall have a few hundred bicycles available, and parking capacity for a few more. An average commuter, upon getting-off at the nearest station shall walk into the cycle stand and get one issued for himself and cycle to his / her exact destination. There after the cycle can be returned at any of the stands around the city from where the commuter wishes to change his mode of transport.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Such a service can be readily made available to the public at a very reasonable cost of say, approximately a thousand INR a month (unlimited) or based upon usage (plus security) for an individual. Setting up the whole infrastructure on a complete city wide basis for a metropolitan city like NCR might cost a few hundred crores. And amongst the innumerable benefits that might come as a by-product will be - <strong>dramatic reduction in dependence on and consumption of petroleum, eradication of pollution due to vehicles, decrease in traffic jams and accidents which shall thus amount to enormous savings in terms of money, time and environment and help commuters live a long, healthy and peaceful life.</strong></p></body></html>
