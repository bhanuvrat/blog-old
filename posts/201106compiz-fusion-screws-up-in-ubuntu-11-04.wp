<html><body><div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">A new recruit, at <a href="http://amiworks.com/">AmiWorks</a>, got Dell Vostro with Ubuntu 11.04 to work on. Being new to Linux he was enjoying the experience but a little while later when he had played all the pre-installed games the excitement of a new OS started diminishing. And he was now in the state of comparing Linux with Windows. He approached me asking for something exciting to do with his Linux box and I obliged.<br>The most fascinating thing that boggles a new Linux user is the rotating cube virtual desktop arrangement. I exclaimed "Okay, I will show you something, that will make you forget Windows forever". And installed Compiz Config Settings Manager. Since I have not tried Ubuntu, I didn't know that Unity didn't support Compiz. So it broke and left me in a fix.<br>Now the guy had the opportunity of mocking my statement "Something that will make me forget Windows forever .. aha". Having no previous experience with Natty I could restore the system to the way it was, only with a little help from #ubuntu IRC.<br>Firstly chose restore to defaults on ccsm (compiz config settings manager) and then fired<br><div style='font-family:"'><pre class="console">$ unity --reset <br></pre></div><br>on the terminal. This fixed the situation on that computer and should be helpful for anybody else who screws up in a similar manner.<br><br>Moral: Don't boast off about ccsm until you have yourself tried it on the new configuration.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8140814052305023172-1160792897981090349?l=bhanuvrat.blogspot.com" alt=""></div></body></html>
