<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">Recently a talk show was shot by CNBC inside my college campus. No I was not sitting amongst the applauders, I happened to be around and stood by for a while to grasp what they were debating about. A closer eye or rather ear, revealed that the matter under consideration was the same old stuff - development, budget and corruption. The conclusion which they seemed to be arriving at was better management and allocation of funds and closer monitoring of activities etc. And I was like what? Haven't they already tried every permutation and combination of that in the past six decades? And the predicament still persists which compels me to suggest a look at the problems from a different point of view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For simplicity, consider the example of students, mature enough to understand their goals (say &gt;14 yrs). What are they supposed to do? Gain knowledge right? But how many students do we find running madly in pursuit of knowledge? The present system of education which rewards better performers with marks and grades has got the students focused at marks alone, knowledge has taken a back seat. Students have successfully derived methods to hack the system, gain good marks with minimal efforts - read, learn and practice nothing more than what will be asked in the exams and retain that only until the exams are over. The result is an ever increasing crowd of unemployed graduates.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Now coming over to the bigger and complex world of grownups. It is complex because not every body has to do the same thing and not everybody is rewarded on the same scale. An average person , take for instance a government employee, is expected to do some work and in return he gets money (reward) as salary. Now, if money is supposed to be a motivator, a corrupt employee must be working harder as he is earning under the table too. But is that the case? My opinion - money, just like marks, distracts the person and takes the place of the goal that was supposed to be accomplished.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Later when I had a casual discussion on this with <a title="@prash-pacific" href="https://twitter.com/#!/prash_pacific" target="_blank">Prashant</a> he told me that I was not the first one to have discovered this bug in the system, its existence has scientifically and statistically been proved and companies like Google are reaping huge benefits by implementing the solution. He also referred me to this TED talk - <a title="Daniel Pink on the surprising science of motivation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvAUbU9Y" target="_blank">Daniel Pink on the surprising science of motivation</a>. I seriously recommend watching it. Mr Pink suggestes the solution based on Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose, I couldn't agree more. I myself have had instances when I have worked harder for things that I wanted to do because I wanted to do them and no one was standing with a reward or punishment at the close.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Now lets get into the bigger problems which initiated this train of thoughts. The problem is not that there is a lack or mismanagement of funds but that the people who are working have the salary as their only target and have been completely ignoring the bigger picture. The ease with which the system can be fooled into believing that work is actually being done (on paper alone), while there is none - doesn't help either. No no no no, don't misinterpret this for the requirement of a stricter and more stringent employee monitoring subsystem because <strong>if</strong> I deem the money to be above all then come what may, I will be able to find a way that averts the pressure and lets me lead a load free life forever while maintaining a continuous flow of thick wads of currency notes. However, if we have people who work, not for the money but because the task is their passion and no one but their conscience is pestering them with deadlines, how long do you think that the petty problems that throttle the growth of our nation (or the whole world) be able to survive?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One may ask, where will we find such saints in this materialistic age? Oh, we most certainly can, as we are looking for common people who dream about changing the world whenever the materialistic system is not giving them a false sense of the unquestionable supreme importance of money. The age as only as materialistic as we make it. We can also replace the education system which compels students to discover methods of corruption with something that induces self motivation and a sense of purpose and patriotism. May be then it won't even take a decade to solve all the problems that have haunted the development of our beloved motherland for six.</p></body></html>
