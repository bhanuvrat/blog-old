Grub2, i.e the one that comes with present versions of ubuntu makes it fairly simple. All that needs to be done is to edit the /etc/default/grub file and add the path of image to it. eg<br><div style='font-family:"'><pre class="console">$ GRUB_BACKGROUND=/path/to/your/image/file<br></pre></div>then fire<br><div style='font-family:"'><pre class="console">$ sudo update_grub <br></pre></div>on your terminal.<br>Upon next reboot the favourite image shall be set up as the bootloader's background.<br><br>Reference<br><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Splash%20Images%20and%20Theming">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Splash Images and Theming</a><br><br></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8140814052305023172-435246319290859879?l=bhanuvrat.blogspot.com" alt=""></div></body></html>
