<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">I am just back from a "Blogger's Meet" organized by indiblogger.in at Hotel Park, Connaught Place, New Delhi. The event showed the hardwork put in by the indiblogger team. Turn out was good, people enjoyed to the fullest. In one sentence I can describe it as a perfect event comprising of an unbelievable yet real mind reading magic show by @karansinghmagic, a not so interesting (yet necessary) ad campaign by the sponsors and a debate and quiz anchored by an impressive and talented TV personality known as @rajivmakhni where they rained smartphones, tablets and usb drives as gifts and prizes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd consisted of all sorts of bloggers (food, tech, photography etc) from Delhi and adjoining areas. The views expressed during a short debate on security concerning mobile devices exhibited the sorry state of tech awareness amongst Indians on the whole. I mean if bloggers, who obviously are at least computer literate can be scared of and believe in tell tales about mobile phones being hacked and data being stolen under most wierd conditions (eg not connected to any data network) or viruses infecting their devices, privacy being invaded then, Probability save the country. I tried and put forward my opinion on this issue which was : Data that people are generally scared of falling in the wrong hands (eg personal info like birth date, phone numbers etc) has already been distributed willingly by us so many times, not just in the virtual world but in the physical world too (to educational institutes, banks, government services etc) which has most likely been stored electronically that for somebody striving hard enough to obtain it, it would be a piece of cake. And being oblivious to basic knowledge essential for using a device safely will only give rise to a kind of PEBKAC (Problem Exists Between Keyboard and Chair - i.e USER) and if such users fall prey to petty attempts of crackers ( != hackers) NO ONE ELSE IS RESPONSIBLE. The mantra recited in many superhero flicks which came to my mind after I was done speaking seemed very apt : <strong>With great power comes great responsibility</strong>.</p>

On the whole had an awesome weekend, enjoyed, met a lot of new faces and had free dinner at a 5 star hotel :)</body></html>
