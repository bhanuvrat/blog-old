<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">So it has been somewhat 20 days since I was graciously chucked out of the college upon successful completion of the four year engineering course. And now I am in a unique kind of situation, which I am going to describe in this post, which is why it might remain a private post on my blog for a very long time to come. I have four job offers, one from the Digit Mag, one from a friend's startup in pune, another achieved through reference in a kind of stabilized startup and finally from a multinational (american) company. And apart from all of these, I have quite a handful of contacts (if I try and count 7) who would very much like me (and help me financially too) to start a business of my own instead of joining a company. The problem is ... which way to choose?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as the jobs are concerned, there can be more if I try, send out resume, talk to people etc. but the four alone have confused me like anything. Following premises summarize the cause of my dilemma:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">All are promising nearly the same amount of money as salary but people say that joining an MNC will be better in the long run and its good start the career with a brand name.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">All except the MNC, would like me to stay for quite sometime, who instead would go an extra mile and ask me to sign a bond so that I can't leave before 2 years.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I know, wherever I go, I will find something of my liking. While I applied in startups where I knew the work would be up to my liking and feasible (given my skillset) whereas the MNC where college got me placed doesn't care about my skills, and will put me on a project which would be needing more manpower.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The views I have got from people has clarified some doubts but has done nothing for eradicating my dilemma. I am more inclined towards choosing better work instead of brand name. I might be committing the biggest mistake of my life and ruining my entire career but what I don't understand is how would it be possible for me to attain success doing work that I would not like. I might also be inclined towards the startups because of a sense of pride - this is an offer that came my way because of my skills and on my own accord unlike the one arranged and distributed by college.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I hope the infinite loop which has been analyzing the available options in search of the optimum one will pause for a while after I have successfully dumped my thoughts here and my mind will be at peace. I am inclined but have yet not made up my mind entirely, and whichever way I go, I am sure I will be able to make it the right choice. And quite possibly I would like to read this and re-acquaint myself with the thoughts that haunted me for about a month when I was on the verge of starting a new career.</p></body></html>
