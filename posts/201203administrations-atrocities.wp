<html><body><p>Recently my aunt expired. An unmarried lady in her mid-sixties who used to live with my family for past 20 years that I remember. When this unfortunate event occurred, naturally my father called me and asked me to come back home immediately. I booked an Air Ticket right away and was planning to leave after meeting the authorities - the HOD of my department and the Hostel Warden. They had been quite supportive till recently. However, when I approached the HOD for a leave application for the present case - which included abstaining from college for 13 days and missing exams, he rejected my plea. His logic was that
</p><blockquote>the cremation would have already taken place what would you accomplish by going home now?



if someone's mother of father expires then its a genuine case - but you can't leave for the death of an aunt.</blockquote>

He didn't permit me to go but said

<blockquote>I can't stop you if that's what you wish to do but I am not allowing you - you will bloody loose everything.</blockquote>

Very naturally since it was my father who needed me back at home I was determined to leave so I went to the Hostel Warden who refused to officially grant me leave without a written permission from the HOD. I left none the less.



When I came back and approached the HOD again for permission to appear in the re-minor exams he lost his temper and said some unpleasant things

<blockquote>This is how you aim to work in the corporate - by running away. They won't stand you even for a day - you will be fired the moment you do something of this kind.



I am sure a delay of 3-4 days would have made no difference - had it been your father or mother then I would have understood the urgency to leave. We had marked the false attendance of a student for one whole month while he was home trying to manage his expired father's business. But she was your aunt and it couldn't have been that urgent.



I can blacklist you from all awards, get you thrown out of the hostel and not allow you to sit for the re-minors. How dare you disobey my direct orders?



etc</blockquote>

Though later he signed my application permitting me to sit in the exams which never took place, he did successfully disturb my mental peace for a while there with his atrocious statements. I kept smiling blankly at him all the while he was saying those things as I did not trust my expressions to remain polite and humble while he was stress testing my patience. The responses forming in my mind which I never gave were

<blockquote>Minors are not important - I have seen the marks being forged out of thin air.



I am having full attendance - even if I am marked absent I won't go below the 75% mark.



I am here for two months only - I won't regret it even if I am kicked out of the hostel.



I have got plenty awards from the university and now aim to be awarded by some other organizationÂ  - your threats are not scaring me



Heck, even if you rusticate me from the college and don't give me the degree I won't be starving for two meals a day - the one and only constructive thing that the university did was to provide me an environment where I could explore and learn and no matter how hard you try you can't take back what I have learned in the past three and a half years.</blockquote>

The insensible and senile headed creatures who are put on the highest posts have always seemed to be a little crazy to me - either the power or the pressure hampers their mental ability and clouds their sense of judgement. If he couldn't help at least he could have kept shut and not uttered the stupid and illogical reasons of why he didn't expect me to leave.



The only thing that I don't understand is why and how can they consider their jobs and their chair to be so important being fully aware of the amount of true respect it derives. Hopefully I will be able to retain and properly exercise my mental abilities when I am in their shoes.</body></html>
