<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">Success has been madly chased by every human being since eternity, the definition of which has been different for different individual. However, in today's economical world it boils down to money for many. The equation is simple. For money, one needs a job, and the job needs one to have a set of qualifications. This is where the biggest industry in the history of mankind comes in. Education. The various schools, colleges, universities promise to help an individual fulfill the eligibility criteria placed by their dream job. They also promise the employers to deliver candidates fulfilling their criteria. There is a flaw - humans want everything the easy way - hacking and reverse engineering the system - which in this case breaks it entirely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The life of a student after joining an academic institution comprises mainly of : classes, assignments and examinations. A sincere student is busy with five to eight hours of classes everyday, whatever time is left is consumed by the innumerable assignments from professors who think that their subject is the only thing the student needs to worry about and if that was not enough every term ends with an examination apart from the various tests taken during the term which requires the student to keep everything learnt during the term intact in his head. As the pressure increases, the student is drawn towards smart work instead of hard work:- bunks, proxies, and personal requests to understanding professors relieve the constraint of compulsory attendance in the classes, copying does away with the time taxing brain work required to submit the assignments on time and xeroxed class notes along with peer study optimally enables the students to pass the examinations with good grades.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bottom line is that the students come up with a way to counteract every measure taken by the administration to keep them occupied. And why shouldn't they? The goal of the student has been modified from acquiring knowledge and honing skills to obtaining marks and having fun by the contemporary society (including parents), industry and the educational system itself. The grading / marking system which was probably brought into place for motivating students towards the goal of knowledge acquisition has replaced the goal itself. Be it classroom teaching, assignments or self study nothing crosses the boundaries specified by the syllabus. When students, teachers, parents and even the neighbors consider it to be a waste of precious time to study a word beyond the syllabus, a motivated teacher discussing something extra or a student inquiring about topics out of syllabus become outrageous criminals. The examination has not been left untouched either, the age old art of mugging up and reproducing is defying still proves sufficient for scoring good grades by defying its very purpose.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The industry is dissatisfied with the kind of crowd coming out of colleges because they have obtained the grades bypassing the knowledge which the industry needed. How does one distinguish between candidates if all are running around with equal qualifications? Not getting jobs as per their desire certainly robs the candidates of their satisfaction, and finally the parents who spent their hard earned money, out-sourcing the education of their children find their expenditure go in vain. The cycle repeats, propelling the student into another institution for further higher education.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Many have been debating the efficiency of our present education system. What good are the existing practices when the students, parents and employers are all dissatisfied? Why are they still being followed? Everybody agrees that a change is required but dreads the consequences of the change. A change in syllabi or increase in administrative strictness will be futile as newer workarounds will be found for them too.</p>



<div style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, the only way things can change for better is by eradicating the rigidity of the system. Its obvious that work done by someone who is passionate, motivated and willing will always be better than someone who has been forced into doing it. After an individual becomes adept in the art of acquiring knowledge (i.e knows how to read, write, understand and use computers) what he /she shall need is guidance and continued motivation. As knowledge is freely available in the contemporary age of information technology in the form of encyclopedia, books and video lectures by eminent professors, anybody who seeks it can easily find, acquire and share it. Instead of trying to create, shape and control the system why not let the system evolve and define itself? Such an approach will for sure receive huge criticism from the society but isn't it the very nature of society to resist change, whether it be for better or worse? May be we need to just let go ! For Oscar Wilde said it more than century ago:</div>
