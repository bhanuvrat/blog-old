<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">It was the very first time in my life that I bunked exams while I was not on sick bed having real fun. PyCon was being organised this year in Pune and I had planned my trip two months before the date - train tickets - conference registration etc. A week before the scheduled departure, college came up with the dates of the mid-sem examinations which just happened to clash with my journey. After analysing the importance of the conference and exams I appeared in four, submitted an application for the last two and flew.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pune was awesome, I stayed at the same place where I had put up during <a title="Interning at AmiWorks" href="http://blog.anuvrat.in/2011/07/interning-at-amiworks/">my internship days</a> - <a href="http://www.amiworks.com">AmiWorks</a>. And the venue of the conference was at a distance of 15 minutes walk from there.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There was some problem with wi-fi at the venue because the organisers were legally bound to give everybody a username and password for accessing the network and somehow the router database that they had setup was lost. So there was a huge list of usernames and passwords in a text file which needed to be fed into the router database through an HTML. Having attended the talks I was interested in, I was out for air when this problem surfaced and I too was requested to help. Being a lazy human being, I simply refused to do that repetitive and tedious task and offered an alternative of making the computer do it. So I sat down and created a bash script using xdotool which would control the mouse pointer i.e take the pointer to the textbox, click, enter values and click "add" button. This script would add one record in approximately 2 - 3 seconds.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the same time interval, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/noufalibrahim">Noufal Ibrahim</a> came up with a python script which bypassed the User Interface and directly submitted the result to the server. And this script uploaded the whole 5 - 7 hundred records in less than 3 minutes. While we were at it somebody took a picture and posted it on twitter <a href="http://twitpic.com/6lm8m0">http://twitpic.com/6lm8m0</a> :) . Though I had read about python's being easy and fast to code in and blah blah blah it was here that I practically experienced it.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I attended the sessions I was interested in and spent the rest of the time talking to the geeks and gurus outside the hall as gyan was in the air all around. In no time it was the third day of the conference when I realised that despite having the camera in my bag all the time I hadn't taken a single picture. So there was this photo - session :)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It was indeed a very nice experience, and totally worth missing the two exams. :P</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I hope I will be able to be there next year too :)</p></body></html>
