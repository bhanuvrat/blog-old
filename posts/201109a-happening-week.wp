<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">I got placed and was awarded for Best Summer Internship Project. What really is special is that I was hardly expecting such and such things to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for placement, I was sure that I would not be able to make it past the aptitude round. And I didn't actually want or need an offer either. The only reason I went up to the venue was attendance for the whole day without going to the classes and finishing my work. But then something weird happened, the company professionals started asked the student volunteers to move out of the hall and started with strictest of invigilation. As a result there was no collaboration and  every question paper was solved by one brain only - which is the only reason according to me for my being able to make it through. So the plan of leaving after the first test and completing my work was foobaared now and I had to play along. Then came a written technical test which had questions from almost all subjects studied by me in my B.Tech. The sad part about this question paper was that quite a questions on programming, which I was targetting, had errors - missing braces and impossible options. Again I qualified this test too. Next was the communication skills round in which I took the initiative to start the discussion when there wasn't any - most likely this was what made the difference. Later when the round started, everybody was being given 3- 4 minutes to speak about themselves but the interviewer cut me off in barely 30 seconds. My first thoughts were either I have done something marvellous or screwed myself up. I was amongst the ones that cleared this interview, and was asked to go for the technical round where again I was asked to say something about my self - this time without being cut off at 30 seconds. So I bragged about myself as long as I could and also showcased the articles on me in Global Times. Since it was a technical round the interviewer asked me for the definition of Data Structures and a Cloud. He also asked me whether I would be willing to work in Chennai, to which I responded positively with an argument that I have already been living out my my home and there is no way that I can make it back there, so the rest of India is the same thing for me. Next question was whether I would be interested in working late night shifts - again I responded positively supporting it with an argument that the exams while my engineering courses have taught me to work late night and until I get married, late night shifts shall not be a problem. To this he inquired about the after marriage state and I said with an attitude that by that time I would have an authority to request the authorities to change my shifts and if that does not happen I will make my services available as and when they shall be required. Then came the HR, who was again keen to listen to me speaking something about myself, knowing whether I would have any problems relocating to Chennai and working late night shifts. I repeated my answers. This interview took place in a room that I had spent most of my time last year, so it was kinda nostalgic. One different question he asked was why were my marks less in B.Tech compared to school. I wanted to pass this question but he wouldn't let me. So I thought for a second stealing time by appreciating the question and answered with aggression devoid of rudeness stating the facts that I had been into electronics in my school days and into computers in my high-school days and had got myself engrossed in books keeping the tech-stuff aside which fetched me good marks. But in B.Tech I am not doing that because I feel that the my job would require my skills instead of my grades. I also added that I have been following this philosophy since before 3 Idiots came out. After a lot of waiting the results were declared and I was amongst the 18 selected from 500.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the Best Summer Internship Project Award, I had no expectations. I had heard the rumour that students who were adept in the art of sycophancy  were the ones to get nominated for the awards and I being the least interested, didn't give a damn. However this year things changed a bit for the better. I have strong reasons to believe that I was nominated for the award because of my previous track record of being tech geek. Amit flew in from Pune, in order to attend the award ceremony and was awarded for being the best industrial guide besides being requested to sit beside the dignitaries like the Chancellor and Director of the college.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In short the week passed without any tech stuff happening still I enjoyed it.</p></body></html>
