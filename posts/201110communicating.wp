<html><body><p>So the way we communicate has changed, drastically in the recent past and this was what I tried to highlight in my Communication Skills presentation test. Gradually noises that the ancestors of humans made, got transformed into voices composed of words that had meaning. Printed media and text came by and stayed as the prominent medium for long distance communication for quite a long time. Next big revolution was caused by the advent of internet and this change is still in the process of setting in. What has happened is that the set of terms used for describing communication has been populated with new ones like, chatting, mailing, tweeting, facebooking and what not.


Sitting at the Bloggers Meet Delhi organized by cupidspeaks.com I came to know about another such means. The merchandize partner for the event called bushirt.com has come up with an idea of wearing your emotions - literally. The idea, at first, seemed amusing and even funny to me but in this fast paced life where people have been limited to using emoticons for expressing emotions, probably this is what will help.



In my opinion however, not having time enough to read the emotions off the face of our friends and family and getting to know about their mental state through their status message or the caption on their T-Shirt is not what the human race should be getting into.</p></body></html>
