<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">Back in my best summer vacation ever, when I was <a title="Interning at AmiWorks" href="http://blog.anuvrat.in/2011/07/interning-at-amiworks/" target="_blank">interning at AmiWorks</a>, I had come to know about a product called <a href="http://www.magazinify.com/" target="_blank">Magazinify</a> which was being tweaked into perfection by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/amanjain">Aman Jain</a>. The idea had seemed to be intriguing - but I hadn't got an opportunity of hands on experience. Recently when I got my Kindle from Amazon, I naturally gave Magazinify a try - and ... I found it MIND BLOWING.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is one of those simple things which one doesn't miss till the instant that one is oblivious of their existence, but after getting acquainted it is hard to imagine life without them. The idea is simple but will need a little bit of situational illustration for a clear picture of <em><em><a title="Reason for existence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raison_d%27%C3%AAtre">Raison d'être</a></em></em> of the product. Whenever an average computer user is near his machine, he (read as he or she) is generally busy with something and hence goes about bookmarking articles / blogposts etc for reading in future when he is free. But such an occasion rarely comes around when one actually finds time to open and read old bookmarked stuff because naturally he is busy when he is around a computer with an internet connection.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So AmiWorks came up with a web service called Magazinify, which provides a bookmarklet ( a button in the browser) which converts the article bookmarked with it to a pdf document and emails it to the user in a digest. Now such an approach makes it possible to read and rejoice during an interval when one is purposely in need of something for killing time eg -</p>



<ul style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Journey - flight delay, long train ride, bus ride during peak hours</li>
	<li>standing in a long queue outside an ATM,</li>
	<li>waiting outside an apparent VIP's office  - because they think the number of people waiting is exponentially proportional to their importance</li>
	<li> waiting for one's romantic interest - who is always late when you are on time,  <strong><em>etc</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Such awesomeness bundled with elongated battery life of Amazon's Kindle is really easing my life a lot. Hats off to <a href="http://www.amiworks.com">AmiWorks</a> for its incredible innovation.</p></body></html>
