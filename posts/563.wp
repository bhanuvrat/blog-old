<html><body><p>Meanwhile my HTC Explorer which is basically an Android phone had been proving itself to be of extreme assistance whenever I needed information on the go. Most commonly I was using the maps apps for asserting whether my velocity was taking me closer to my destination and changing the direction vector in case it was not.


So when I got myself a Firefox Fusion bicycle, (yes, the name firefox defaults to a kind of web browser in my head too) pulling the phone out of pocket every time I needed to consult the maps seemed like an unnecessary waste of time. To add to that, since the phone went into standby and disconnected itself from the GPS satellites whenever I put it back, it took a long time before being able to tell me my exact location. Excited by the amount of information apps like sports tracker and GPS Speedometer gave, I determined that I wanted the phone right in front of me every instant of my ride.



What I did might be considered crude, clumsy, geeky or a simple ugly hack, but it serves my purpose. I took the cover of the phone, modified it and attached it to the handle of my bicycle with the help of stiff wire and some duct tape. The modification involved cutting the case, puncturing it etc which basically ended its life as a mobile case. Now it behaves as an awesome mobile dock which holds the phone safely during my ride is lets me undock the phone easily.



Now my bicycle has a meter that is costlier than itself and richness of whose information way better than that of maximum cars and motor bikes :)</p></body></html>
