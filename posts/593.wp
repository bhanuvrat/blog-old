<html><body><p>Dear politician,
Please don't waste your time (that I have paid for in the form of taxes) trying to control the Internet, people using / running it are much smarter than you and will find a work around regardless of what you do. Your desperate efforts to censor the internet will either kill a growing industry or push it unto the darkness of the black market like the outlawed / heavily taxed / banned commodities like books, movies, alcohol, drugs etc and make it even more difficult to monitor it. The Internet, for the first time has made people think of themselves as global citizens please don't kill it.
