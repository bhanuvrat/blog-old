<html><body><p>It was right on Day one that I formatted my new Laptop's hard drive to create partitions on it and install Linux. Well that was in fact a failure because of the <a href="http://bhanuvrat.blog.co.in/2010/04/09/problematic-acpi-on-new-dell-studio-1450-laptop/" target="_blank">ACPI problem</a>. But after I came to know about acpi=off work around I managed to install linux and then the most torturing problem on my system was absence of sound. I nearly spent the whole next week trying to figure out (rather google out) the solution. But it was not there. It was just day before yesterday that I stumbled upon the solution.<br><br>The problem was :<br><br><strong>There was no sound from the inbuilt speakers, and one of the two jacks worked but produced sound which was barely audible</strong>. I lingered over forums for a very long time - meanwhile switched and tried different distros .. hoping one of them might come with a solution by default.<br><br>Attempts made by me to solve it:<br><br>Most of the times when I looked into search results that said "solved", what I found was "the audio channel was muted". I also found posts that asked me to modify the modprobe.conf and add dell-m6 after intel-hda-snd etc. but none of them worked ... in fact I found a complete <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob_plain;f=Documentation/sound/alsa/HD-Audio-Models.txt" target="_blank">list</a> of such options that could be appended on to the modprobe.conf file and tried every one of them that was related to dell.<br><br>Recently After installing Arch Linux I came across OSS - Open Sound System and installed it instead of ALSA.. it seemed to work but I couldn't figure out how to mute the speakers while using head phones. I was determined to look for the solution in the same direction.<br><br>Solution:<br><br>The way to get it to work is to install the new version of alsa ( god why couldn't I think of it .. argh).

And <a href="http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=740934#p740934">this</a> is where I was spoon fed with it.<br><br>I am loving it :)</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8140814052305023172-7320029566379771772?l=bhanuvrat.blogspot.com" alt=""></div></body></html>
