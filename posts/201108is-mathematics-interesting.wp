<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">Ask a student, the answer will most likely be NO. But is it really so?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It would be a fair lie to say that I liked mathematics since the very beginning. Initially, I hated maths as everybody does but then I got to know that present day Computer Science - my raison-de-etre was a combination of Mathematics and Electronics! Most of the renowned computer scientists eg Donald E Knuth are Mathematicians by education. And when I got enlightened with the presence of Discrete Mathematics I became sure of its awesomeness. The way I looked at the subject changed entirely. This made me ponder about why, after all, did I hate Maths initially?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While I was still looking for the solution, I came across <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/conrad_wolfram_teaching_kids_real_math_with_computers.html" target="_blank">this TED talk</a> given by Conrad Wolfram. And not only cleared my dilemma about why I hated Maths, but also why I hated, whatever I hated, about the Education System I have been a part of.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Seriously, Maths had been solving problems by hand only to match the answer given at the back of the book but it is so much more than that. I have understood it and I sincerely hope the right people get it right in time, because its the right of the student to learn Maths the right way.</p></body></html>
