<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">Yesterday, was one of the very first occasions of my life, when I faced a situation in which, personal differences of two members of our technical team increased to a level, where it was effecting their mental peace and hence the efficiency of the team and I had to come up with a solution. Before that moment, I had been on either side, from where the other person appears to be morally, ethically and logically incorrect and the solution too is simply a bashing for the other guy. But being the president of the club, now I found myself at a juncture, where black and white demarcation was gone, everything was grey and I was completely at loss of ideas on how to bring their minds back at peace. For a second it occurred to me that, the present situation might very well be a miniaturised manifestation of what awaits me in future, where my actions would determine the survival of the organisation I would be a part of. Keeping the horrors aside, I decided to talk to them and help them realise that using the platform of the club to gain knowledge, develop, sharpen and apply their skills, to achieve their goals was the reason behind their being a part of the team, which clearly outweighed the then most significant matter for them - their personal differences, on a scale of importance and priority. I also tried to press upon the fact that I and team members from batch same as mine, would be there for very few more months, after which they would find themselves where I now am, and they themselves would have to solve problems similar to the one at hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the short discussion their minds were at peace and mine was wondering back in times when I had been in their shoes, recalling how the hurdles and hardships of the past which then seemed to be the very end of life, became an amusing tale to be told in an appropriate company. Also the general human tendency to crib about present, miss the past and long for future came in my thoughts. Now I wonder, if the problems that our brain registers as very serious and scary are at all what they seem to be. Come what may, if we calm our minds and consider troubles to be trifles they might very well turn out to be so. And just after finishing this sentence, I realise that this is same as the idea which "ALL is WELL" wanted to convey.</p></body></html>
