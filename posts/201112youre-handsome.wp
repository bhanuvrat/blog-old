<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">It was one of my room mate's birthday today, so we were out there in the plaza area of the university - partying. Just as I took first bite of my Pizza somebody tapped me on my shoulder. Naturally I turned around. The lady standing behind me instantaneously pointed to the other corner of the room and said - "That girl, Krita, over there, thinks you are really handsome". Frankly, it was the first time I was complimented by a complete strange, or strangers rather, and all I could do in response was say "Oh, Thankyou". The lady retreated to her table, giggling on the way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Later, I noticed that the group of those three girls was engaged in a game of Truth and Dare and what made her come up to me must have been a dare. Anyways, it was a unique experience and I feel that it deserves to be recorded in the time capsule, hence the post.</p></body></html>
