<html><body><div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">Spelling mistakes are common on signboards in India. They spell things just the way they want, showing utter disregard for the language. And when the respectable authorities do it ... it becomes just intolerable. I just couldn't resist clicking a stop sign which asked passengers to stop for "CHEAKING".

The only thing that this makes me wonder is if spelling and pronunciation and proper grammatical formation of your sentences are not so important in the big bad world why are children taught, punished, humiliated and graded low at school?

And if it is important, why does no body give a damn, instead of just mocking and walking?
