This is where most of the first time users end up loosing all their data. I had lost mine too ;). Don't worry I am not trying to scare you off. Its just that you need to be a little more careful and back up all your data before you proceed.<br>Most of the user friendly distros provide you with appropriate disk management tools for setting up your filesystem. What boggles the first time users is the invisibility of C: and D: drives that they have been so used to. Here they are referred to as /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 and some more alien symbols :P. <a href="http://bit.ly/fv9ZIm">Here</a> is more information on the naming convention for partitions.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning#PC_partition_types">And here is </a> more <i>gyan </i>about primary and extended (or logical) partitions.<br>One more thing that is worth noting is that there can be a maximum of four primary partitions on a harddrive whereas there may be any number of logical partitions and most Windows OS boot from a primary partition only while Linux is capable of booting from logical partitions also. <br>Basic needs while installing a dual boot system may be<br><br><ul style="text-align:left;"><li>obviously, being able to boot into both OS at will.</li><li>access data from both OS.</li><li>have space to install and try more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">distros</a>.</li></ul><div><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">This</a> is a wikipedia article on UNIX / Linux filesystem hierarchy. A bare-bone Linux installation needs two partitions to work properly: root (/) and swap. With this said and done I would like to show my own partition scheme and then explain what made me do so.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-y-nnsKE3PGU/TYDqgUzIceI/AAAAAAAAAG4/R0TXx2KZmx4/s1600/Screenshot.png" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-y-nnsKE3PGU/TYDqgUzIceI/AAAAAAAAAG4/R0TXx2KZmx4/s640/Screenshot.png" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align:center;">My stable partition scheme - developed after months of tampering and reinstalling.</td></tr></tbody></table><div>The screenshot is pretty much self explanatory, however, what needs a little bit of introduction are the following:</div><div style="text-align:left;"><ul style="text-align:left;"><li>Repository (NTFS) partition: One thing that the windows operating systems are famous for (apart from their baseless user-friendliness) is their proneness to crashes and viruses. One should prefer keeping data on a partition other than the one containing system files so that a reinstall of windows does not wash them away.</li><li>Swap: This partition is used by all Linux / UNIX based operating systems for the purpose of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging">paging</a>. More info on Swap space is available <a href="http://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/8208-all-about-linux-swap-space">here</a>.</li><li>Home partition: My idea of a separate and central home partition shared by all the Linux distributions is something that allows me to keep all my files on one drive irrespective of the location I OS I work from. And hence I do not have to hunt for files on different OSs when I need them. </li><li>The other partitions you see are the root partitions of different OSs that I tried followed by the free space available for me to try more distros ;)</li></ul><div>Although its not much of a problem form me now a days but ext (or Linux partitions) can not be accessed from Windows. Although many tools are available for facilitating that, I didn't find anything that would work flawlessly. So one should refrain from storing files on the Linux partition that might be required while running Windows, otherwise switch over to Linux completely.</div><div>This is something I found to be a stable configuration for my harddisk partition scheme and the idea is an independent production of my idle brain after months of wondering and tampering and re-installations. Hope this helps a troubled soul lost in the fromatting dilemma finding peace and decide on a partitioning scheme.</div><div>There shall be more posts on easily and successfully how I configured a multi-boot system.</div></div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8140814052305023172-3967926591516906326?l=bhanuvrat.blogspot.com" alt=""></div></body></html>
