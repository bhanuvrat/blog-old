<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">I spent the last weekend with Satyaakam. It was a different kind of experience. The adventure started with me meeting him at Century Communications Limited in Noida Film City. Satyag's brother was shooting an add film there for some new car. Later we left the place and my plan was to meet Narendra but it turned out that he was going to meet Prof. Kannan. When I came to know that Prof. Kannan was in town I thought why not go and pay him a visit? So we hung around some more while I had a little trouble with IBS. Later in the evening we went to IIT Delhi where Prof Kannan was attending a meeting of NMEICT.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me, Satyag, Narendra and Prof. Kannan had some discussion about the prospects of the Spoken Tutorials Project for a while and then left for dinner. At the dinner table I met Prof Mangal Sunder who has been heading the NPTEL project for last 10 years. Having been an avid user of NPTEL's videos I was excited to meet him in person. Actually I had got to know about the videos from my Communication Systems teacher Mr Kapil Bhardwaj sometime nearing the end of the fourth semester.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Later I crashed at Satyag's place and we hacked some code at night and in the morning and I came back to the hostel by Sunday evening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I for sure enjoyed the weekend but there were some things that were not so good about it. I was expecting to find a job, while discussions with Satyag made me wonder about taking up projects on a freelance basis. Indeed job would have its own kind of tension and this mode of working would have its own. Seriously, the jobs being offered by the college placements are not meant for me, I don't know what approach would be the best for life. After this weekend what I have understood is that it is me who will have to make my own way and that no one whosoever will be able to tell me what to do for a successful life. So the game is on !!!</p></body></html>
