<html><body><p>The problems, the hardships, the tough times all seem to be a trifle from a distance and you only forsee what would be good and glittering. However, just recall for Â the time being how difficult was the time when you had been there. All that you had imagined about the good times was suddenly took over by the dark and gloomy situations. People getting angry at each other over petty differences and creating an air of tension. And the happiness didn't even last as long as you had imagined it would - probably it was there but went unnoticed in the gloomy air.


Now the thing that you need to think about is do you really want to be there in future? The determination of spending the latter half of your life there, seems to be withering away.



The problem is that when people live together, it is but natural for situations with mental and pyschological tension to arise. And it can be attributed to unfullfilled expectations that people develop / deserve from each other, egotism. Someone with a sane and impartial mind can't classify one as right or another as wrong in such cases because the sympathetic opinion keeps shifting from one to another.



So I wonder if I should decide to live together with human beings irrespective of the relation I might have with them? Probably keeping safe distance yet maintaining a social circle is the best way out ... but only time will tell what would happen.



Here goes a blog post which I would like to read years down the line, comparing the perspectives that I held at times :)</p></body></html>
