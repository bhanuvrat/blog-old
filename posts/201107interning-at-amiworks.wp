<html><body><div style="text-align: justify;">The curriculum for B.Tech (CSE) in my college, like many others, requires me to pursue industrial training in my third year. Just as my batchmates, I too was anxious to secure a place for myself in an organisation related to my field of work and my area of interest. Meanwhile, I volunteered to take a session on Introduction to Qt at  <a href="http://osscamp.in/event/osscamp-lucknow-1103">OSS Camp 11.03 Lucknow</a> and there, I met <a href="http://twitter.com/thecancerus">Amit Singh</a> who offered me a place as a Summer Intern in his company, <a href="http://www.amiworks.com/">Amiworks</a>, Pune. The offer was appealing and I accepted it.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">After my exams I reached Pune and joined AmiWorks on my birthday. It took me a week to settle on a project, but once that was set, there was no looking back. I tried and developed a File Sharing and Syncing Application using <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/">PyQt</a>. While <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt </a>was something I was familiar with, I chose python because firstly, I wanted to learn it and second, my room-mate cum Co-founder of AmiWorks, <a href="http://twitter.com/amanjain">Aman Jain  </a>motivated me enough to embark on an unknown path. I won't bore you with the details of the project, as that is to be submitted to the college in a report which is hardly read by anyone. What I intend to share is the exhilarating experience I had while interning at AmiWorks.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">First of all, my residence and office were in the same three storey building. All I had to do was climb a flight of stairs to get to my office, so I was spared the travelling woes and I was able to sleep an hour extra everyday ;) . The office itself was cool, big windows, balconies, greenery all around and pleasant weather of Pune. The working environment was even more awesome - a comfortable chair, bean bags, dual monitor setup, 16Mbps Internet etc made it feel like heaven for a programmer.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Ah !! it wasn't all work and no play. We used to have musical afternoons where <a href="http://twitter.com/adwait22">Advait</a>'s talent covered everybody else's musical n00bh00d. And I also watched quite a mouthful of movies in the two month span with my room mates cum colleagues, both in theatre and on Youtube ( the 16Mbps belonged to just four of us after office ;) ).</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">In short "I am missing my internship days" and I can't wait for PyCon 11 which is being hosted at Symbiosis Pune, which is when I will be meeting friends cum colleagues again !!</div>
