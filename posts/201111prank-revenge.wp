<html><body><p style="text-align: left;">It was the evening before diwali vacations, so naturally the mob had gone mad. Be it holi or diwali, its no longer about the victorious good or the moral of the story - no body cares about that in the present day - what matters is an industry which thrives on the products which are sold in the festive season and a the full freedom that youngsters get to exhibit their madness out on streets. So, it was the evening before diwali vacations and the mob of my fellow hostel mates had naturally gone mad. The administration had tried everything in their power to stop students from bursting crackers in the campus, but rules and restrictions only increase the excitement and urge to do just the opposite. So there was a gang of my hostel mates lighting crackers hither and thither and the marshall's appointed by the administration were busy chasing ghosts they never caught.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Late in the evening they came over to my room and asked me to step out, reason - they wanted to burst cracker in the common area of my dorm room - playing a prank on one of my room mates (geeks are disliked all round the year except during exams). With fair warnings about my zero tolerance policy on damage of the hardware in my room I obliged, reason - its not wise to stand in the way of a mob, unless you are socially independent and have super powers. This happened twice, and despite my desperate attempts of warning my room-mates, the mob somehow found the door of the common room open to pollute the air and silence.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So I went to the room of the key players of the mob. Crashed at their place for a while, then talked one of them into bursting their own cracker inside their own room, while I filmed one of their room-mates using one of their own camera phones. I got their room polluted without even touching a cracker plus I got a video which we shall show at our college re-union say some 20 years down the line. What say ? Tit for tat?</p></body></html>
