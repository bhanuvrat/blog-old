<html><body><div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">I am sure that I won't find even one single person who has never ever criticised The System he / she is a part of. <b>We, being humans, have a tendency to detest the present, miss the past and long for the future.</b> So do the students. When we were in the school nothing was worse than the teachers and the school administration. When in college, the college administration takes that place and memories of the school life are cherished and we can't wait for getting a job. Then those who are working find it extremely unbearable to be there, miss the student life and long for retirement.<br>We ask for change in The System (Even I do). Forget being the change for a while. The thing we need to ask ourselves is are we mature enough to enjoy the change. Wouldn't we again criticise the changed environment just like a toddler who discards a toy after playing with it for a while? <br>Actually it isn't The System that needs change. Its our attitude. 'WE' here, means everybody who is a part of 'the system', any system, government, education etc, will have to change they way we think about The System. Because its us, everyone of us, who makes The System what it is. For instance, both teachers and students will have to have the attitude of learning something new everyday, have faith on each other and strive for excellence. The people, and the people in power will have to collaborate to resolve the issue instead of "being the issues" and playing the blame game. Once we grow up, stop criticising and demeaning others, stop wasting time on gossiping like the envious women, and strive for excellence, the day won't be far when we will be satisfied with The System and be an example for the rest of the world.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div></body></html>
