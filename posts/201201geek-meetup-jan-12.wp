<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">Delhi / NCR has a community of Linux Users who are basically computer geeks. These are people who would be more than happy to spend a lazy winter afternoon behind their computer screens, hacking on various open source technologies. But you know what makes them happier? Meeting fellow geeks ! This is why they try and meet at least once a month and appropriately call these meetings Geek Meetups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The day when I shall be respectfully asked to leave the university is inching closer. I being the president, of a small club called Amity Linux Assistance Sapience (ALiAS) was getting a little restless about its future prospects - What after I and my fellow ALiASÂ  members from the final year are gone? It had been approximately six months since the last meet and 363 days since the last time it had been hosted at Amity. And it occurred to me - how about letting the prospective successors organize and host the next Geek Meetup at Amity. And so they did !</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from bringing the old members together again, this also allowed the new comers to interact with the community which in turn enhanced their enthusiasm and exposed them to a whole new world. I am sure that the club and the open source culture that had been initiated during my tenure at college will continue to live in the campus long after I am gone.</p>
