<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">The four year course of engineering in computer science that I was pursuing has come to its close. I attended the concluding ceremony (<em>samapan samaroh</em>) today in the afternoon. On a lighter note, it was a journey from a free lunch (for students coming for admission interview) to free supper (after the concluding ceremony) by the college. At the ceremony, I received two awards - one for being the president of Linux Club and another for "best summer training" and a provisional degree . Heck! I am officially an engineer now!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last four years ...  Don't worry it wont be sentimental, just a short summary with a pinch of nostalgia. The last four years of engineering have been a blend of varied things including self-learning and exploration outside classroom, regular showoff (in a good, geeky way) in class, frequent bursts of pure fun during bunks, sheer ignorance, boredom, laziness and restlessness amidst exams, unprecedented one-night-stand preparation &lt; 24 hrs before every exam, utterly <a title="Prank Revenge" href="http://blog.anuvrat.in/2011/11/prank-revenge/" target="_blank">unbelievable pranks</a> in hostel, unintentional and non premeditated chivalrous flattery flirting, sparse timely submission of select assignments, totally unprepared appearing for viva and practicals, geeky hack nights with the geeks of ALiAS (Linux club), trips to a few meetups, conferences and events concerning FOSS or Linux, invitations to drinking and smoking parties that I always forgot to attend, stroll (mostly solitary) around the campus after dinner almost every evening, totally unpredictable sleep/wake cycles, regular hunt for audio visual entertainment material (movies) in hostel ... the list has no end!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the intended curriculum my fours years of engineering have undeniably taught me some unintended yet useful set of skills. One is the Art of Waiting :taught throughout the campus at places like  cafeteria and general store counters, ATM, before project presentations &amp; placement interviews, for meeting higher authorities and these ultimately came in handy during the very few ultra boring lectures. Another one is more versatile skill of jugad - the ability to instantaneously and successfully derive, device and deploy a solution for any problem with whatever limited resources available at hand (self incriminating examples withheld).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A process, however interesting or boring, once started, it eventually ends. So has my engineering course. Now on a slightly sentimental note, I know that life will move on and the circle of my acquaintances will constantly keep changing, evolving and growing but the place which had been created in my mind by the faculties cum friends, friends cum ex - batch mates / juniors / linux club members for themselves, can't and hence shall not be overwritten - they are ROM now.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As the course for engineering is over, I hope and expect myself to begin with some engineering soon. Tech Anecdotes shall have more posts, perhaps with an increased frequency and from a new perspective but the source shall be the same blob of neurons, as long as they are is safely housed inside my skull. <strong>Now that I am a B.Tech I shall try and be tech :).</strong></p></body></html>
