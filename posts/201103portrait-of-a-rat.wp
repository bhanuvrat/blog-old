One day I requested Mr Rat to pose so that I could take a picture Â and post it on my blog ;) .

Just kidding !! It got caught accidentally on new years eve and I couldn't let it go without taking a few pictures :P. For the Animal Rights Evangelists, I took it far from my hostel and released it near a gutter on the New Years Day. There are still many that keep plundering my food stuff. :(
