<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">The month of February has nearly passed and there hasn't been a single post on my blog in somewhat a month and a half! This calls for at least an update on why there was no activity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the Jan'12 Geek Meetup the free time seems to have vaporized. Of course there were the usual classes, assignments, viva, and tests which deserve no mention.Â  First off the final year project was taking up time like a resource hog. After trying out all that I and my project-mate could have done for the gesture recognition software that we had initially proposed to create we realized that it would not be possible to complete the project in the assigned time frame. So we requested and got the project to a smart home automation thingy which does nothing more than switching lights on and off - with an android phone and over the web. Though our surrender did disappoint my project guide, I am sure the end result of our present endeavours will satisfy his expectations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Then came the annual fest of the college. Given a choice I wouldn't have been anywhere near it. But they asked every club (I preside the Linux Club) to come up with at least one event. So we (the club buddies) thought, WTH, lets do it and proposed an online and an on-the-spot competition. The online competition was immensely successful after taxing on a few nights sleep (thanks to Python and Django). The on-the-spot one also did fairly well considering the fact that all the prospective participants were organizing their own competitions at the same time somewhere in the campus.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Another interesting thing for me during the fest was the workshop. The primary trainer for an android workshop which was supposed to be organized during the fest came up with insatiable demands at the 11th hour so the organizers approached me. Was it disappointing to be the second choice - no it was an opportunity. I had planned to introduce the Python way of app development for android (kivy, python-for-android etc.) since the audience in question was not comfortable with Java, teaching them Java would not have been possible in the time frame and I was (still am) too fond of Python to try and train people in Java when given a choice. So we dived into Python and soon the participants were requesting for more of Python instead of Android. So the alleged Android workshop turned out to be a Python Workshop and everybody enjoyed it (including me).<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_8466.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-476" title="IMG_8466" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_8466-300x225.jpg" alt="android workshop attendees" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Next came the GATE exam which had got neglected amidst the everything above hence the hopes aren't high enough. But still I enjoyed appearing in the only exam which tests my logical abilities instead of the integrity of my brain's hard drive i.e my capacity to mug up and reproduce. Later, in the evening I attended the Delhi Wiki Meet which was again refreshing experience -interacting with wikipedia contributors.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Then something happened which took me a thousand kilometers away - home. I bunked the mid-term exams and abstained from classes which has critically annoyed and offended the college administration - hope things turn out to be okay. At least I got to appear in the re-exam. Ohh, this reminds me that I have an exam in three hours. Should get engrossed in books now. Laters.</p></body></html>
