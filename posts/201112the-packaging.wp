<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">No matter how much emphasis has been given on inner beauty instead of outer prettiness, we humans still fall for the attractive. Though this sounds similar to the way humans select their mates, what I am going to talk about is more important. This tendency of man-kind to prefer the better presented over the actually better one gave rise to the advertising industry. Now, I am not saying that it is unethical or something, I just want to cite that it needs to be limited somewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This may be good for business but it doesn't only disappoint the consumer once in a while, but also effects the environment at large. Yes the environment. We may have banned the use of poly-bags in major cities but the consumer goods ranging from biscuits to soaps everything comes in a heavily decorated plastic container which are being used in greater profusion than the primitive plastic <em>ki thaili</em> even in the areas where the use is banned.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, what I don't understand is why do we need more glamour on the package of the actual product when newspapers, magazines, tv and Internet are already being heavily utilized for the same purpose. Whats the use of decorating the package when the consumer is just going to throw it away. In my opinion we can have a simple paper cover mentioning the name of the product along with a link to its website. Much more subtle, don't you think?</p></body></html>
