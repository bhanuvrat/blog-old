<html><body><div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;"><div style="text-align:justify;">Recently I met a would be engineer who aspired to prepare for CAT and go for MBA right after achieving his B.Tech. This brought back all the reasons I have heard from people choosing MBA after engineering.</div><div style="text-align:justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align:justify;"><b>So why do people go for MBA after engineering? </b></div><div style="text-align:justify;">Statuary Warning: These are my thoughts and no offence is intended to anyone, if you feel offended you are more than welcome not to read any further.</div><ul style="text-align:justify;"><li><u>Learning Managerial Skills</u></li></ul>If it is only about learning, why not learn it the only way skills can be acquired i.e by getting hands dirty and practically doing stuff. If one can't learn to swim by only reading books and one can't learn to write programs by mugging them up for exams, I am pretty sure that it is equally impossible to learn the MBA stuff only reading books. And all the colleges will get you to do is, read, mug up, vomit and so on...<br><div style="text-align:justify;"><br></div><ul style="text-align:justify;"><li><u>Position - being a manger and governing fellow engineers</u></li></ul><div style="text-align:justify;"></div><div style="text-align:justify;">In a system where actual learning happens only on ones own and a  degree can't certify one to be a better engineer or manager against  another, why do companies rely on them and promote MBAs only? Not sure  if this happens everywhere, but if it doesn't then why are the engineers  crazy for MBA?</div><ul style="text-align:justify;"><li><u>Engineering was a wrong choice.</u></li></ul><div style="text-align:justify;"></div><div style="text-align:justify;">So you want to say that you were counselled and compelled by your  parents because offsprings of their acquaintances were going for engineering and it  was never your aim. And that this time your decision is based upon the  counselling of <u><i>your</i></u> friends, seniors, acquaintances, you  are not going in the wrong direction. </div><div style="text-align:justify;">Or perhaps it was one of your "To Err is human" thingy. How can you be so sure that you  won't curse MBA just like you did engineering, afterwards?</div><div style="text-align:justify;"><br></div><ul style="text-align:justify;"><li><u>I don't know Engineering - they taught nothing at college.</u></li></ul><div style="text-align:justify;">Again how do you know the college would teach you something? And it won't be the same mug up and vomit cycle for 4 end-sem exams?</div><ul style="text-align:justify;"><li><u>Money - earning more </u></li></ul><div style="text-align:justify;">Haven't you already spent a fortune in terms of time and money  already in order to obtain a B.Tech? Can you afford to waste another  such fortune?</div><div style="text-align:justify;"><br></div><ul style="text-align:justify;"><li><u>Everything that can be achieved with more money</u></li></ul><div style="text-align:justify;"></div><div style="text-align:justify;">Hmm.. if materialistic stuff is all you desire and knowledge has no value in your eyes, you should better choose the easy way of making money, there are many successful icons even in that dimension whom you could follow to become the next billionaire overnight.</div><div style="text-align:justify;"></div><ul style="text-align:justify;"><li> <u>I have had enough ... I can't study technology any more?</u></li></ul><div style="text-align:justify;">Yes, right, you have had enough of technology haven't you? So why not go back in the stone age and promise that you won't buy the next killer phone from Apple.</div><div style="text-align:justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align:justify;">Besides, we all loved 3 Idiots, all engineers embraced it as a mirror of the plights and delights of their very own lives. So how did we end up ignoring one of the many morals (<a class="twitter-timeline-link" href="http://bit.ly/9yU2hQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="http://geeksandindia.blogspot.com/2010/06/7-sequences-from-3-idiots-that-every.html/">http://bit.ly/9yU2hQ</a>)? People who go for MBA after B.Tech and work as a manager are no better than Donkeys (Rancho [aka Phunsukh Wangdu], enacted by Aamir Khan, 3 Idiots).</div><div style="text-align:justify;"><br>Edit: The only case in which such a move is justified is when the person takes full responsibility of his / her own actions and resolves never to blames others.</div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8140814052305023172-7608636822991682433?l=bhanuvrat.blogspot.com" alt=""></div></body></html>
