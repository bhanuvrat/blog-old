<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">I was barely five when, he came into my life. And there are very few things I actually remember form those days, so I wonder how much I will be able to put in here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So the very first memory I have, that remotely relates to my brother is that of my mother asking me whether I would like to have a brother or a sister as a sibling. And as far as I remember I did not have an answer. Neither did I have a clue as to why she was asking that.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Next is of the night when dad took mum to the hospital, I woke up in the middle of the night - all alone - no electricity and I was really scared. When I called out, my aunt came in and updated me with the situation. The next morning I went with papa to the hospital, which is when I got to know that, I too was born here itself. I visited my mother's cabin and saw my brother for the first time. I don't actually remember what he looked like but what I do remember is he was lying next to mum. On the contrary, I do have some recollection of climbing the stairs to go to mum. Papa dropped me at home and went shopping for the new member.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A few days later, on the occasion of <em>chhattiyari</em>, we took some photos and I remember that because those pictures are still there in the family photo album. But alas, in all the pictures he is lying it someone's lap and his face has not been captured. A few days later, his health started deteriorating. Mum and Dad used to be very tense. Frequent visits to the hospitals became a common affair and nobody thought of photographs thereafter.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One incident I clearly remember is of the day we decided to name him Manu. While getting off the scooter after reaching home one day, I recall Papa telling me in his own excited tone: "You remember? we are going to call him Manu form now onwards."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">He had a sharp brain and was a keen learner. Once he was able to speak, learning different phrases and framing sentences wasn't a difficult task for him. He called me "<em>beeya</em>" instead of <em>bhaiya</em> all his life. Intellectually he was strong but physically not so much. I remember what a task it had been to get him to walk. After he was able to stand we had to resort to means like placing colourful balls on different corners of a bed, and he would go around taking support of the bed itself. Soon after learning to walk he learnt how to run and I remember him running to and fro in the longest corridor of our house. The most prominent thing I recall is the way he used to hug me - won't ever forget that.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Fast forward form that, what I am able to recall next is the day everything changed and I it felt as if all the time he was there, was a dream. Like I never had a brother. I had been playing with my school belt, rolling it and pretending that it was a camera. Father was in the <em>puja-room</em>, offering his TuesdayÂ  -prayers, whose duration had only increased after the cause of Manu's illness had been found. I remember someone saying, "<em>iska badan akad raha hai jaldi doctor ke paas le jao</em>". Dad came out running, changed from dhoti to trousers, took the scooter out of garage Mum sat on the back seat with Manu and off they went. It took me a while to realise the gravity of the situation. When I did, I immediately wanted to bathe and go pray for him. Yes, I was really paranoid about <em>karmkand</em> in those days. It was when I was standing near the well, I had that feeling - the whole time he was there felt like a long dream. Even before I could start bathing, parents returned with what was just a body now.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Then I vaguely recall the lamenting episode in the courtyard. I did not feel like crying despite feeling it to be immoral to not cry. I saw mucus flowing out of his nose, rather the nose of his dead body and tried to bring it to everybody's notice that maybe he was still alive and breathing. But that was just impossible to be believed. While I was trying to go near the him - his life less body, to probably verify the fact for myself, my grandmother pulled me to herself - something that she never used to do.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After some time my father, along with a group of neighbours took him to be buried and no matter how much I wanted to go along with him, I wasn't allowed to. Days passed and everybody got busy with their daily lives. We shifted to a bigger town - I got into a more standard school and memories of him kept fading away. Because ever since the day he left I felt like I never had a brother - ever and all the time that he had been there feels like a soothing dream now. And alas, I don't even have a picture of him to prove to myself that I had a brother - once upon a time.</p></body></html>
