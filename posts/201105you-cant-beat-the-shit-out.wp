<html><body><div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">A friend with managerial background once complained that he can't withstand people making weird noise with their burps right after dinner. And that he feels like "beating the sh*t out of them". To this my immediate and involuntary response was that "Technically speaking, you can't beat the sh*t out of the person who had just had food. You would more likely be immediately successful in beating the vomit out of him. :P Upon my remark he tried to justify by stating the implied meaning of his previous statement.
The third guy, a layman (inÂ  other words a genius), in our company got seriously agitated with the nature of this discourse, and screamed "Shut it, you geeks!!". And laughter took over !!!</div></body></html>
