<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">A problem in any field of science that hasn't been solved till this date is termed as an open problem - open for all interested persons and parties to wrack their brains on. Yup, here as another post on social problem, opening with a reference to science - <em>ki kara geekism control nahi honda</em> :P</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what do I exactly mean by OPEN social problems? Any and every problem, issue or situation  that people, politicians, celebrities and media-wale pick from time to time for a discussion, debate or a deliberate discourse, in search of an opportunity to express their views and thwart the opponent's opinion thereby establishing or consolidating their intellectual and oratorical supremacy (except media-wale who's lives thrive off the spiced up drama) without ever reaching a strong, sustainable, sensible solution to the problem which can be implemented in a real world scenario for ever being able to curb it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Pretty cool for a definition, don't you think? Well 16 years of formal education will convert even the dumbest of idiots into definition inventing ninjas provided they <a title="Examination – whats the point?" href="http://blog.anuvrat.in/2011/04/examination-whats-the-point/">refuse to ever or resolve to never mug up and remember the exact contents</a> of their petty text books.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Coming back to the central idea of this post, such discourses can be witnessed in diverse locations depending upon the people involved in them. Eg neighbours at the local tea stall, politicians on a panel discussion on a news channel, celebrities in reality shows and relatives at occasional family gatherings. Every once in a while, motivated and passionate individuals pick an issue close to their heart and try their level best to sell their version of the solution, or at least spread awareness, though to an unbiased observer it might look like an unparallelled historic revolution turned melodramatic publicity campaign in short a magnanimous waste of time. And its not because the leaders lack dedication but because of something that's known since Shakespearean age and media tries to en-cash everyday - "The mob is fickle minded". If that's not the case then tell me why corruption continues to survive and thrive after the greatest non-violent war against it in the history of our nation?(<a title="All Hail Corruption !!" href="http://blog.anuvrat.in/2011/04/all-hail-corruption/">link</a>) Its easy to create a buzz and get people excited but the effect wears off and that, is a damn reality.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A well known celebrity has started yet another Talk Show aiming to tackle one problem every episode. Now this guy, is executing a commendable idea and doing a great job. The show has revved up even the laziest of Indian minds. But being an engineer my brain is trained to be skeptical, test the phenomenon for its chances of success and here I sense more futility than fertility. Reason - we are still doing what we always do and hence are best at it - talk and show - the actual work takes a back seat as usual.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What you don't believe that we concentrate more on showbiz? Here are some examples: ask existing (or would - be engineers) graduated (-ed +ing)  from an average Indian college and you would find that they spent more time bringing the design and layout of the report upto their guides expected definition of perfection instead of the actual content of the report (<a title="LaTeX is awesome !!!" href="http://blog.anuvrat.in/2011/08/latex-is-awesome/">unless they knew \LaTeX</a> ).  This is because our brains are trained to fall for better looking packages instead of their contents. Why do you think ads about every other commodity excitedly mention "Our product is available in an ATTRACTIVE NEW PACK" when all we do with the pack is throw it in the bin (<a title="The Packaging" href="http://blog.anuvrat.in/2011/12/the-packaging/">link</a>). The question we need to ask ourselves is whether the extreme importance that we give to the blatant exhibition of sincerity and external perfection will ever solve actual problems?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The conclusion is: something somewhere has gone severely and insanely wrong and the situation will steeply worsen unless we do something sensible sometime soon. Blah blah blah, enough mumbo jumbo, until people actually act on the advice they are always ready to give away, probability knows that even this thing will turn out to be just another talk show and will effortlessly be pushed out of citizen's minds just like an old toy chucked out by a toddler upon the arrival of a new one. And had we already been doing just that, there would have been no need of such an elaborate display of concern - because there would have been no situation to get too concerned about.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">And since I know that expecting people to follow their own advice is like asking America to destroy all its nuclear war heads - I believe that there shall be no dramatic changes and that the world as we see it today, is here to stay.
