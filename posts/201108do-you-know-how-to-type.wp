<strong>Geek</strong>: Are you sure?



<strong>Average Computer User</strong>: Yes, whats there to know about it.</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the good old days of typewriter, typing used to be a skill possessed by few and people used to learn typing for increasing their employability. And then came the era of computers and brought along with it the ability to edit / modify / correct text. So now there was no need to be 100% accurate when you type because you could easily rectify the error. Gradually most humans evolved into an Average Computer User (ACU) who does not explore the computer beyond a movie player, music player and uses the <em>default</em> browser for mail, facebook and youtube.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">An ACU types in different ways :</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Beginner, ACU</strong> :- two fingers. Hunts and picks. Head keeps moving up and down for every character typed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Intermediate ACU</strong> :- four fingers. Hunts and picks. Eyes oscillate between screen and keyboard for every word typed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advanced ACU</strong> :- two - three fingers of the left hand and 3 - 4 fingers of the right hand. Hunts and Picks - Eyes oscillate between screen and keyboard for every sentence typed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ultra Advanced ACU</strong> - Uses all 10 fingers. But still hunts and picks. Faces a lot of problem on a different keyboard because of change in spacing between the keys.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Come on ACUs !!! Learn to type properly - Raise the bar for qualifying as an ACU. Everybody starts to type with two fingers but it doesn't have to be that way forever. I started typing the same way and had attained considerable efficiency typing with four fingers but then I saw my computer teacher at school, keying text in, at an incredible speed, with all his fingers without looking what his fingers were upto. I realised that I also wanted to type like that and determined to learn. My father who had learnt touch typing in his own days, and had lost speed because of staying off the keyboard showed me the way. It for sure did take me a while to attain even my usual speed and tasks that should have been completed in 10 minutes took 30. A few days later I was comfortable with it and much faster.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/typing-speed.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-221 alignleft" title="typing speed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/typing-speed-300x247.png" alt="" width="240" height="198"></a>I learnt to type on QWERTY-layout and have attained a decent speed of 70 - 90 wpm on it. But if the above text has inspired you, you should try and learn to touch type on DVORAK. Visit <a href="http://www.dvzine.org">www.dvzine.org</a>Â  if you are wondering what/why or how. In short DVORAK was a scientifically created layout for speed, accuracy and comfort while QWERTY was just a random arrangement of keys. So someone determining to learn touch typing should go for DVORAK. I am in the process of switching and have attained considerable efficiency. Though I know that I would have been able to type this post in less than 10 minutes on QWERTY I am doing it in DVORAK because thats the only way to learn.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a discussion on the LUG@IITD mailing list. It started with <a href="http://narendrasisodiya.com">Narendra</a> looking for gloves as a remedy for his aching wrists but drifted to how using DVORAK can be the solution.
