<html><body><p style="text-align: justify;">The past week has been quite a happening without any of the usual techie fun. First of all I got placed in an MNC with a decent salary package despite doing adverse stuff like going for the interview without proper formals and with unshaven beard, submitting the full four page CV against advice of many,Â  answering the questions as aggressively as I could without being rude etc. So it was quite a surprise to me that I was amongst the 18 selected out of 500. This also strengthened my belief in the fact that skills are more important than looks and that there <strong><em>are</em></strong> people who understand its value. Now I have all the time in the world to do the tech stuff without being bothered by questions like "How come YOU are not placed yet?". So its cool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, my Summer Internship Project was adjudged to be the best amongst 700 others and I was awarded for the same. My Industrial Guide cum a techie friend flew in from Pune to attend the award ceremony where he was awarded for being the Best Industrial Guide. These, added to the extreme fun and tech-masti I had at AmiWorks, <a title="Interning at AmiWorks" href="http://blog.anuvrat.in/2011/07/interning-at-amiworks/">make the two months of my Internship</a> - the best times of my life.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ah, its time to pick up the books again because the exams are approaching so the post has to stay short, sweet and simple and I have to wait some more before starting with geeky stuff again.</p></body></html>
